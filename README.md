Lost and found: Music Zine Theme
A lightweight, performance-focused WordPress theme built for independent music journalism, record reviews, and scene reporting.

Project Philosophy
Lost and found is designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain. It moves away from "legacy bloat" by utilizing modern PHP 8.x features, a clean class-based widget system, and modular templates.

Zero Bloat: No heavy libraries or jQuery dependencies for core navigation.
Performance First: Optimized image loading (eager for featured images).
Modular Architecture: Logic is separated into /inc and /classes for better organization.
